In today's dynamic financial markets, research analysts face the challenge of efficiently processing vast amounts of equity news to extract 
valuable insights for informed decision-making. However, the sheer volume and complexity of available data make this process time-consuming and prone to oversight. 
To address this issue, there is a need for an advanced Language Model (LLM) tool tailored specifically for Equity News Research analysis. 
This tool should be capable of comprehensively analyzing equity news articles, identifying relevant information, detecting market sentiment, 
and providing concise summaries and actionable insights to empower research analysts in making well-informed investment decisions efficiently.
